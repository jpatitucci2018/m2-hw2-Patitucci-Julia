 <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
 <p>My name is Julia but some people call me Jules. No, I do not have a preference. I am 24 and am originally from Orlando. I have my Bachelor's degree from UF in Public relations and I minored in Innovation and Art History. I moved to Chicago after I graduated undergrad and live here with my 2 dogs: Nova and Atlas!</p>

 <p>Nova is a golden mix and Atlas is a husky hound. Both turn 4 this month!</p>

 <h2>What makes me, me?</h2>
 <p>I enjoy playing with my dogs, traveling, crafting and reading. I have a personal goal to collect 1,000 books so that my collection can be considered a library. I am currenlty 19.4% of the way there! I mostly read fantasy and romance books but I am trying my best to branch out more. Though I do generally prefer to read book written by women.</p>
 <p> Some of my favorite books include:</p>
 <li>The Ballad of Never After by Stephanie Garber (book 2 in a series)</li>
 <li>The Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller</li>
 <li>Before the Coffee Gets Cold by Toshikazu Kawaguchi</li>

 <h2>What's my ideal career?</h2>
 <p>I am on the audience analytics track in this degree and with that I hope I can work with a company and analyze their data to help them achieve their goals. I would prefer to work with readily available data such as sales or social media data. I am not particularly interested in the research side of my track. I am hoping that by taking classes such as this one I can obtain skills to make me a more well-rounded candidate. Ideally, I would love to work in publishing industry. However, I know how hard that can be to break into and thus I am also interested in the fashion or entertainment industries.</p>
